Instance varialbe are the standard variables you use in your classes.
Static varialbes are variables that are constant across object instantiations.

So:
Person a, b, c;
a, b, c will each have their own fullName and age.

But a static variable will be the same wether you use a, b, or c.
a.maxAge, b.maxAge, and c.maxAge will all be 150.

You can deifne a static variable with the keyword "static":
static int maxAge = 150;

This defines an int that is *shared* across the objects.
If it is changed, it is then changed in every object.
a.maxAge = 200
would make b.maxAge be 200 as well.

j = i = sqrt(-1)
4+j3; 4 is the "real part"; 3j is the "imagineary" part.
(4+j3) + (6+j2) = 10+j5

The real part and the imaginary part ar applied seperately.

(4+3j) - (6+2j) = (-2+5j)

(4+3j) * (6+2j) = (24+6j)

(4+3j) / (6+2j) = (.666+.666j)


Inheritence:
 
A student class may require information about GPA, or year of study.
An Employee class may reuqire information about salary, or years worked.

All of these share that they want personal information about a user:
 firstname, lastname, maybe a SIN.
Perhaps a Person class could store that.

The Person class is a superclass, parent class, or base class, depending on who you ask.
The Student and Employee classes are subclasses, child classes
